<span class='headline'>About</span><br/><br/>
Instant Web Mail is a free, web-based POP mail client. It is encredibly
easy to install - however, the easy installation comes at a price:
There are no <i>Sent mail</i> and <i>Trash</i> folders, and there is no
address book.<br/><br/><br/><br/>

	<li>Converts 7-bit headers like
	"=?iso-8859-1?b?xiDY?= =?iso-8859-1?b?xQ==?=" into the
	correct 8-bit version ("&AElig; &Oslash; &Aring;").</li>

	<li>URLs and email addresses are made into links.</li>

	<li>Optional formatting of plain text messages: *Bold* is converted to
	<b>Bold</b>, /italic/ is converted to <i>italic</i>, and
	_underlined_ is converted to <u>underlined</u>.</li>

	<li>Translated into several languages.</li>

	<li>Can be set up to check for new messages automatically.</li>

	<li>Several themes available.</li>

	<li>Customizable: Using the web-based administration page,
	you can easily add a footer to be shown on all pages.
	The front page (the log-in page) can be customized even
	further. All color and font values are gathered in one
	single style sheet, making them easy to alter.</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/><br/><br/>



<a name='requirements'></a><span class='headline'>Requirements</span>
<ul>
	<li>A web host account or server with
	<a href='http://php.net/'>PHP</a> 4.0.3 or a later
	version. You do <b>not</b> need IMAP support in PHP -
	a standard installation of PHP will work.</li>

	<li>A contemporary browser with extensive support for
	JavaScript and CSS. Netscape 4.x and earlier versions
	will not work. Instant Web Mail has been known to work
	in <a href='http://www.konqueror.org/'>Konqueror</a>,
	<a href='http://mozilla.org/'>Mozilla</a>,
	<a href='http://opera.no/'>Opera</a>, Netscape 6, and Internet
	Explorer.</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/><br/><br/>



<span class='headline'>Install</span>
<ol>
	<li>Upload the entire instantwebmail directory to your server.
	That's it! Instant Web Mail works right out of the box (hence
	the name), so if you want to try it out right away, point your
	browser to http://example.com/instantwebmail/index.php and log in.
	However, if you want to change the language or other
	configuration options, you should follow the next steps:</li>

	<li>If you've installed the program on a Unix server (e.g. Linux,
	FreeBSD, or Sun Solaris), you need to chmod (change the permissions of) the file
	settingssaved.php to 666. This can usually be done from within
	your FTP client. Right-click on settingssaved.php, select "Chmod",
	and check the boxes as shown on this picture:<br/>
	<img src='images/chmod.png' height='238' width='347' alt='Chmod'/>
	</li>

	<li>Point your browser to
	http://example.com/instantwebmail/settings.php. Log in with the
	username "username" and the password "password". Now you can
	configure Instant Web Mail to suit your needs. <b>Don't forget
	to change the administrator username and password right
	away</b>.</li>
</ol>
<br/><br/><br/><br/>



<span class='headline'>Questions and answers</span><br/><br/>

<b>Why does it take more than 10 seconds for each page to load even
though I have a fast Internet connection?</b><br/>
The problem is probably caused by the POP server. Some POP servers
perform so-called reverse DNS lookups on the clients that connect to
them. These reverse DNS lookups take time - often more than 10 seconds.
If the POP server is located within your internal network (LAN), you
can probably eliminate the problem by using the IP address of the
server instead of the host name when you log in. Another solution is of
course to ask your system administrator to disable reverse DNS lookups
in the POP server.<br/><br/>

<b>The program can't connect to the POP server even though I'm entering
the correct host name, username, and password.</b><br/>
This might be a firewall issue. Some web hosts that offer their
services for free shut off all network traffic from/to certain ports.
There's nothing you can do but install Instant Web Mail on
another server.<br/><br/>

<b>Why do I get an error message saying that the function wordwrap()/is_uploaded_file()/session_unset()
is undefined?</b><br/>
Probably because you didn't read this readme file thoroughly. It is
very clearly stated in the <a href='#requirements'>Requirements</a>
section which version of PHP is needed to run Instant Web Mail. You
need that version (or a newer one), otherwise the whole thing won't
work. That should go without saying - nevertheless, I get a lot of
emails asking me the above question. If you don't know which version of
PHP is installed on your server, ask your web host, or try running this
script:<br/><br/>
&lt;?php<br/>
echo "You are using PHP version ".PHP_VERSION;<br/>
?&gt;
<br/><br/>

<b>There's a bug in your program. Could you fix it?</b><br/>
I might - if I have the time. However, before you send me a bug report,
please make sure the bug is not listed in the <i>To do</i> section of
this page. If you're sure you've discovered a new bug, send a detailed
description of it to me. If your description is something along the lines
of "The program doesn't display the message text", there's no way I can
figure out what the problem is. I need to know which version of Instant
Web Mail and PHP you're using as well as which operating system and web
server program. Please include screen shots of all relevant windows,
the full message source, JavaScript error messages, etc.<br/><br/>

<b>Do you plan to implement folders and address books?</b><br/>
No. As its name suggests, Instant Web Mail was made with the goal of
offering a web mail program that can be installed within minutes. If
the program were to save information such as sent mail and addresses on
the server, it would cause the setup time to be much longer. Instant
Web Mail was designed to read the mail directly from the POP server,
and it would require a complete rewrite of the program to implement
folders and address books. Also, I might add that implementing folders is a
lot of work - but it's not particularly challenging (the difficult part
when making mail clients is parsing the messages and displaying them
properly, not communicating with an SQL database). When I write open
source software, I tend to like small, but challenging tasks that might
help me improve my programming skills - and making a complete web mail
program with folders just doesn't fall under that category. Sure
enough, if you or your company decide to pay me for making a complete
web-based mail client, I'd be more than happy to - otherwise, forget
it : )<br/><br/>

<b>How can I be informed about new releases of Instant Web
Mail?</b><br/>
Visit <a href='http://understroem.dk/'>Understr&oslash;m</a> frequently
- or go to <a href='http://freshmeat.net/'>freshmeat</a>, create a new
user account if you don't have one already, find
<a href='http://freshmeat.net/projects/instantwebmail/'>the project page
for Instant Web Mail</a>, and click on "Subscribe to new releases".

<span class='headline'>To do</span>
<ul>
	<li>Better handling of multipart/related messages.</li>

	<li>Bug: The decoding of 7-bit headers cuts away spaces in rare
	cases. E.g. the subject line
	"Tester =?iso-8859-1?b?xiwg2CBvZw==?= =?iso-8859-1?b?xQ==?="
	will incorrectly be displayed as "Tester &AElig;, &Oslash; og&Aring;". The space
	between "og" and "&Aring;" has been cut away for some reason.</li>

	<li>Bug: Incorrect parsing of headers that extend to more than one lines. Say
	the subject looks like this in the message source:<br/><br/>
	
	Subject: All your base<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are belong to us.<br/><br/>
	
	Instant Web Mail will display that subject line as just "All
	your base".<br/><br/>
	
	It's important to note that Instant Web Mail does not have any
	problems parsing those multi-line headers that provide
	information about the content type, character set, etc. of a
	certain message part. That is, Instant Web Mail will parse
	headers like the following correctly:<br/><br/>
	
	Content-Type: multipart/mixed;<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;boundary="----asdf1234"</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/><br/><br/>



<a name='changeLog'></a><span class='headline'>Change log</span>
<ul>
	<li>Version 0.60 (March 17, 2002)
	<ul>
		<li>The user may now choose his/her preferred language when
		logging in. The default language is the language specified by
		the administrator.</li>

		<li>Capitalized headers such as "SUBJECT" and "FROM" are now
		recognized.</li>

		<li>Instant Web Mail now uses PHP's built-in error
		handling system.</li>

		<li>For security reasons it is no longer possible to write
		extra headers besides the normal ones when composing
		messages.</li>

		<li>I've given up on magic_quotes_gpc : ) This means I will no
		longer write additional code to remove slashes that were added
		automatically by the PHP parser. If magic_quotes_gpc is enabled
		on your server... tough luck!</li>

		<li>New theme: "Chatvillage".</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Version 0.59 (March 10, 2002)
	<ul>
		<li>Some corrections were made in the Italian language file.</li>

		<li>The German language file was corrected once again.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Version 0.58 (February 3, 2002)
	<ul>
		<li>Fixed a couple of wrong default settings in
		settingsSaved.php.</li>

		<li>Removed the border around images.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Version 0.57 (January 28, 2002)
	<ul>
		<li>Fixed a bug that caused the preset server names, usernames,
		etc. to be displayed as "A" on systems where magic_quotes_gpc
		is on. The same bug was also the cause of a "foreach" error
		that occured when you edited settings.php.</li>

		<li>New Croatian translation.</li>

		<li>More corrections in the German language file.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Version 0.56 (January 22, 2002)
	<ul>
		<li>The annoying problems with magic_quotes_gpc were fixed. In
		earlier versions of Instant Web Mail, I tried to turn
		magic quotes off by including a .htaccess file that contained
		the following command: "php_flag magic_quotes_gpc off". However,
		that only worked in some instances. In a lot of cases, the
		command either didn't work at all, or it caused an "Internal
		Server Error" message. I decided to remove the .htaccess file
		and write some code at the top of functions.php that handles
		the magic quotes issues.</li>

		<li>New theme: "Grand Issue".</li>

		<li>A minor error in the German language file was
		corrected.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Version 0.55 (November 13, 2001)
	<ul>
		<li>The German translation was updated.</li>

		<li>The Spanish translation was updated.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>

	<li>Version 0.54 (October 26, 2001)
	<ul>
		<li>New Icelandic translation.</li>

		<li>The Italian translation was updated.</li>

		<li>The Turkish translation was updated.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>

	<li>Version 0.53 (October 9, 2001)
	<ul>
		<li>A new Slovak translation that replaces the old
		one.</li>

		<li>New Czech translation.</li>

		<li>Most other translations were updated.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>

	<li>Version 0.52 (September 30, 2001)
	<ul>
		<li>Removed the crypt() function from settings.php
		because it caused problems with people not being able
		to log in.</li>

		<li>Added the .lowCheckBox class to the style sheets in
		order to insure that the check boxes in the header list
		don't take up so much space that they enlarge the
		subject table rows.</li>

		<li>New Slovak translation.</li>

		<li>Updated the Norwegian translation.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>

	<li>Version 0.51 (September 23, 2001)
	<ul>
		<li>Some people were unable to log in using the default
		username and password. I think I solved the problem. If
		some if you still can't log in, contact me, and I'll
		take another look at the problem.</li>

		<li>In order to make it clearer to the user which links
		are attachments, a tiny image is now displayed next to
		all attachment links.</li>

		<li>Added a logo image.</li>

		<li>New German translation.</li>

		<li>The "Cysol" theme: New font color in text
		areas.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>

	<li>Version 0.50 (September 15, 2001)
	<ul>
		<li>URLs are made into links now.</li>

		<li>You can now delete multiple messages directly in
		the header list.</li>

		<li>Fixed a line break bug in write.php which on some
		Unix systems caused the Content-Type header to appear
		in the body of the message.</li>

		<li>New themes: "Dark City", "Ochre", and "Silver
		Sage".</li>

		<li>Spanish translation.</li>

		<li>Improved README.html.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>

	<li>Version 0.41 (September 6, 2001)
	<ul>
		<li>New theme: "Cysol".</li>

		<li>New theme: "Yellow".</li>

		<li>French translation.</li>

		<li>Updated the Latvian translation.</li>

		<li>Updated the Turkish translation.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>

	<li>Version 0.40 (August 29, 2001)
	<ul>
		<li>It is now possible to have more than one preset POP
		server, port, and username. In settings.php, you can
		enter a list of POP servers, ports, and usernames to
		use, and then Instant Web Mail will display those lists
		in select boxes on the log-in page.</li>

		<li>Added another field to the log-in screen: "Your
		email address". The reason is that a lot of
		people have complained that Instant Web Mail doesn't
		show the correct "From" address in the compose window.
		Unfortunally, it's almost impossible for the program to
		guess the user's email address since there are tons of
		different ways of writing POP usernames - so what
		better way to solve the problem than let the user
		specify his/her email address?...</li>

		<li>settings.php now has help texts for some of the configuration options.</li>

		<li>The bug that caused certain message bodies to
		disappear should be completely fixed now.</li>

		<li>Updated the Norwegian and the Turkish translation.</li>

		<li>Swedish translation.</li>

		<li>Polish translation.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>

	<li>Version 0.30 (August 24, 2001)
	<ul>
		<li>The bug that caused some message bodies to
		mysteriously disappear has been fixed.</li>

		<li>The ability to set the priority of outgoing mail
		has been added.</li>

		<li>New theme: "Blue".</li>

		<li>Brazilian Portuguese translation.</li>

		<li>Italian translation.</li>

		<li>Norwegian translation.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>

	<li>Version 0.22 (August 19, 2001)
	<ul>
		<li>Added the possibility to request return receipts.</li>

		<li>Better attempts to guess the user's email address
		in the compose window.</li>

		<li>Dutch translation.</li>

		<li>German translation.</li>
		
		<li>Portuguese translation.</li>

		<li>Turkish translation.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>

	<li>Version 0.21 (August 17, 2001)
	<ul>
		<li>In version 0.20, the default language had been set
		to Danish by accident. Version 0.21 changes the default
		language to English.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>

	<li>Version 0.20 (August 16, 2001)
	<ul>
		<li>Added theme support.</li>

		<li>Optional formatting of plain text messages: *Bold*
		is converted to <b>Bold</b>, /italic/ is converted
		to <i>italic</i>, and _underlined_ is converted to
		<u>underlined</u>.</li>
		
		<li>Internet Explorer and Opera users might have had
		problems replying and forwarding due to JavaScript
		issues. These issues have been resolved.</li>

		sender address in the compose window to be something
		like "someone@example.com@example.com".</li>

		<li>Russian translation.</li>

		<li>Latvian translation.</li>

		<li>Improved about.php.</li>

		<li>Improved README.html.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>

		user clicked on "New letter".</li>

		<li>Improved README.html.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>

	<li>Version 0.11 (August 12, 2001)
	<ul>
		<li>Added automatic checking of new
		mail.</li>

		<li>Fixed a minor bug that caused the recipient and
		sender address to be the same in the "Forwarded letter"
		portion of the compose window.</li>

		<li>Improved README.html.</li>

		<li>Improved about.php.</li>
	</ul>
