Version 1.0.2 - Walt A. Boring IV <waboring@buildabetterweb.com>
  - added 3rd parameter to the HTMLTagClass constructor.  It
    accepts the $newline_after_opentag setting.  This helps
    to keep the nice formatting on certain tags that you want
    to override the default behaviour.

  - fixed HTMLPageClass character encoding bug.  It wasn't
    outputing a proper meta tag.
  - changed doctype for 4.0 to 4.01
  - added target param for the html_a() helper function.
  - changed the default parameters to html_img_href, and
    html_img.  We were forcing the width and height of an image
    to 1x1 if nothing was passed in.  We now don't add them to 
    the tags if they aren't set, which is the desired result.

  - Changed the FooterNav class to add the ability to show a
    "webmaster" mailto link.  I also cleaned up the formatting
    of it a bit as well.

  - fixed source formatting issue with html_img_href()
  - changed html_a() to always force no newline after opentag
  - added $target to html_img_href()
  - added html_th() helper function.
  - Changed html_textarea.  Added a new parameter of Value
    so you can prepopulate the text area field with data.
  - Fixed a bug with InfoTable's render() method.  It wasn't
    properly handling the output_debug param.
  - Added TODO file.
  - Added a new feature to automatically htmlentities() for
    tag attribute values if we are rendering in XHTML_STRICT
    mode.  This prevents the w3c validator from complaining 
    about the & char.


Version 1.0.1 - Walt A. Boring IV <waboring@buildabetterweb.com>
  - added html_div(), and html_td()
  - added html_div(), and html_td()
  - fixed w3c validation bug for the TextNav class.  
    We can't put a background image in a td.  It Has
    to be in a css.
  - Fixed a <TD colspan> issue for a blank entry in the 
    NavTable class.     
  - reorganized html_utils.php so the functions are in
    alphabetical order.  Should be easier to find them
    as a reference.    
  - added usemap attribute support to html_img() and
    html_img_href()
  - updated the online API docs (javadoc output) in the
    doc directory.
