  phpHtmlLib INSTALLATION


  Introduction
  ============

  I have tried to make the phpHtmlLib fairly easy to install
  and to use on anyone's current running site.  There are a few assumptions     
  I've made, but it shouldn't be a problem for 99% of the folks out there.  I   
  haven't tested the libs in a windows environment, as I don't have a M$ O.S. 
  installed anywhere in my house.  If you encounter any issues, please let me    
  know.  I welcome any and all feedback.
  
  Thanks and enjoy,

  Installing the libs
  ================================================

  1. Overview for the impatient
     --------------------------

     $ mv phphtmllib <your webdir DOCUMENT_ROOT>
     
     NOTE: in your script, set a global variable $phphtmllib to the
           location of your phphtml install.  If you installed it into
	     your DOCUMENT_ROOT, you would do 
	   <?php 
	      $phphtmllib = $DOCUMENT_ROOT . "/phphtmllib"; 
	      include_once("$phphtmllib/includes.php");
	   ?>

  2. Requirements
     ------------

     The following requirements exist for using phpHtmlLib :

     o  PHP version 4.0.x 


  3. Installing
     ----------

     1. Copy the entire phphtmllib directory into your website's source
        tree.  I typically install it in DOCUMENT_ROOT/phphtmllib.
	  You don't have to have it installed in the document root, but that is
	  where I normally install it.
	
     2. In each script that uses the libs, you MUST set a global variable
        $phphtmllib to the path of your phphtmllib dir in your web tree.
	  So, if you installed phphtmllib in your DOCUMENT_ROOT, like I do,
	  then you set $phphtmllib = $DOCUMENT_ROOT . "/phphtmllib"
	  I usually do this at the top of my scripts, or have a include file
	  of defines and such that sets this.
	
        After that you should be able to include the main includes file
	  include_once("$phphtmllib/includes.php"); to include all of the files
	  in the lib, or you can include each file that you need individually
	  to save include processing.
