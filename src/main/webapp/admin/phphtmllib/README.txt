  -=What is it?=-
  ---------------
  
   phpHtmllib is a set of PHP classes and library functions 
   to help facilitate building, debugging, and rendering of HTML. 
   It provides a mechanism to output perfectly indented/readable 
   HTML source, and a programmatic API to generating HTML on the fly.
  
 
  -=The Latest Version=-
  ----------------------
  
  Details of the latest version can be found on the phpHtmlLib
  web site at sourceforget.net.

  -=Documentation=-
  -----------------
  The current documentation can be found in the doc directory.
  I plan on adding live API documentation to the project's web
  site.  This will be after the 1.0 release.
  

  -=Installation=-

  -=Acknowledgments=-
  -------------------
  
  I would like to personally thank a few good friends of mine
  that have helped me during the development of phpHtmlLib.
  Richard Koreski, HTML guru and Daniel Ceregatti, long time friend.
  Also thanks to my wife Allison for helping me in all the right ways.
  
  I'd also like to thank the folks at Zend for writing such an excellent engine for PHP.  
  PHP is by far the best web language on the planet.  
  
  Oh yah, and thanks Linus!
